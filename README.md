## Overview

This repository contains a selection of highly detailed, 1:1 mechanically accurate 3D models for rendering, MCAD integration or engineering simulations. Each model is provided in the following supported formats (Please view [Supported formats](#supported-formats)) with relative drawings and tolerance whereas available. 

## Supported formats

Currently each 3D model will be provided in the following formats:

- [x] Step (.step, .stp)
- [x] Iges (.iges, .igs)
- [x] STL (.stl)
- [ ] Invetor (.ipt, .iam)
- [ ] Sat (.sat)
- [ ] Obj (.obj)

Currently drawings supported formats:

- [x] DWG (.dwg)
- [x] PDF (.pdf)
- [x] PNG (.png)
- [ ] CSV (.csv)

## Support file conventions

Each model's resource files are provided within a folder named after it's EAN, whereas available, and structured as follow: 

- XXX.step
- XXX.iges
- ...
- XXX-drawing.dwg
- XXX-drawing.pdf
